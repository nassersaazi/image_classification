# Cassava Disease Image Classification System

<div style="text-align:right">By Nasser Saazi</div>

## Problem statement

Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is vulnerable to virus disease, which threaten to destabilise food security in the sub-Saharan Africa.
Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection.

The prime aim of this project is to build a model that can classify multiple input leaf images of a plant as healthy or diseased. If the plant leaf gives positive results of a disease, then the type of a disease is to be further determined as well. In our project we focus only on multiple detecting and classifying cassava leaves suffering from some common cassava diseases.

## System Components

# 1. Model

This is the supervised learning algorithm that is being used to train the image data. More details about this are in the model folder
` Completed`

# 2. Api

This is used as a bridge for the web and mobile apps to the machine learning model. The flask python framework is used to build the api

# 3. Web Client

This is the web application that will be used by different stakeholders to interact with the system. More deatails about it are in the webapp folder

- [ ] To be completed soon

# 4. Mobile App

This is the mobile app that farmers will use to interact with the system. The source code for this is in the mobile branch of this repository

- [x] Completed

# 5. Database

This is the store of user information for every user of the system
